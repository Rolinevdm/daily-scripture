<strong>Jeremiah 22:13-14</strong>
13 Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbourâ€™s service without wages, and giveth him not for his work; 14 That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is cieled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
