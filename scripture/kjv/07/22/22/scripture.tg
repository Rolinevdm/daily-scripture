<strong>Judges 6:14-16</strong>
14 And the Lord looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee? 15 And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my fatherâ€™s house. 16 And the Lord said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.
