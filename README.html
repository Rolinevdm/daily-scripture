<strong>Isaiah 59:21</strong>
21 As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seedâ€™s seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.
