<strong>Hebrews 11:24-26</strong>
24 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaohâ€™s daughter; 25 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; 26 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.
